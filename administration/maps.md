## How to show the map based on an address field

Since 3.9.0 version every Address field has a corresponding Map field. All you need is to put it on Detail layout. It uses Google Maps service.

`Administration > Layout Manager > Choose entity (Account, Contact, Lead or custom one) > Detail > Drag & Drop Map field.`

Make the cell wide using the minus sign.

You can also configure the height of your field.

`Administration > Entity Manager > Choose entity > Fields > find the map field and click on it > edit the height and save.`
